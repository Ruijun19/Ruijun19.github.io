# 👏 About Me

My name is Ruijun Wang and I am currently working as a data analyst at Inner Mongolia Yuhong Construction Engineering Co., Ltd., China.

My main research interest is the use of artificial intelligence technology to address complex problems in engineering, such as equipment prognosis and health management (PHM), energy prediction, and defect detection. Specifically, I am developing signal processing, machine learning, or deep learning methods for fault diagnosis and remaining useful life prediction of centrifugal fans, turbine rotors, wind turbine gearboxes, bearings, and other equipment in power plants; Constructing intelligent methods for predicting wind speed and wind power; Using computer vision technology for defect detection of wind turbine blades and solar panels 😄.

💥 Currently, I tend to study the compatibility between traditional signal processing and deep learning, considering using professional domain knowledge to guide the convergence of deep neural networks. Meanwhile, I am also interested in algorithms in the field of AI for Science, such as PINN and Neural Operator 😃.

I graduated from the School of Energy, Power, and Mechanical Engineering at North China Electric Power University (NCEPU) with a Master's degree, under the guidance of professors [Xiaoxun Zhu]() and [Xiaogang Xu](). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Civil Engineering at Inner Mongolia University of Technology (IMUT). During my studies, I served as a student assistant for one year at Beijing Huazhidian Technology Co., Ltd., under the mentorship of [Yu Wang]() and [Xiaoxia Gao](). Additionally, I worked for one year as an engineer at Inner Mongolia Taili Engineering Construction Co., Ltd..

During my Master's program, I engaged in substantial research work and was honored as an Outstanding Graduate Student (Top 10%) at NCEPU in 2022 👍.

My primary research focused on equipment fault diagnosis and condition monitoring based on signal processing techniques and deep learning algorithms. I have published 7️⃣ SCI papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=goCftmoAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRuijun19%2FRuijun19.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> , several of which were published in top international journals such as IEEE TII and Measurement. ❗ <span style="color:red;">**NOTICE: All papers that listed my supervisor as the first author and me as the second author were independently completed by me.**</span> Additionally, 8️⃣ more SCI papers are currently under review.

I participated in editing a textbook; Led and participated in multiple cooperation projects with large energy groups such as State Grid Corporation of China and State Power Investment Group Co., Ltd.; I have attended numerous academic conferences and supervised several undergraduate thesis projects; To enhance my skills, I completed an algorithm training course in artificial intelligence.
